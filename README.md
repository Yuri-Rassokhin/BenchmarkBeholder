# BenchmarkBeholder

BBH is a tool for large-scale performance benchmarking of any application.

# What It Is

BBH brings value to R&D in performance analysis in the long run, in the large projects, when you need to

* Benchmark your workloads in hundreds or thousands iterations
* Run benchmarks on many machines
* Collect results in a centralized way through months and years
* Involve multiple users or multiple project teams
* Make the results easily reproducible
* Store the results in a form convenient for BI, such as PowerBI or Excel

In other words, it comes in handy to those who created a quick script for benchmarking a while ago, and now is drawning in chaos as the project grows. BBH will be accurately accumulating your benchmark results at the organization level, and keep it for years in a centralized database, always ready for analysis.

# What It Is NOT

* BBH is an overkill for just one-time launch of your benchmark
* BBH is not a benchmarking tool per se. Rather, it's a benchmarking framework that takes a given benchmarking tool (or application), runs it in given configurations, and collects associated metrics

# How Does It Work?

Any application can be integrated with BBH by writing a simple hook in Ruby. Out of box, BBH already has a collection of integrated applications.

BBH is invoked as the following:

* As input, BBH takes a config file describing *parameter space*, that is, a Cartesian of the valid values of all the parameters you want to benchmark your application against
* After that, BBH runs the application against all theÂ  combinations from the parameter space
* During the runs, BBH collects specified application metrics, enriches them with infrastructure metrics, and pushes everything to a database
* Finally, the database of benchmark grows as a single, centralized table structured in accordance with your projects and/or user teams

# Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yuri-Rassokhin/BenchmarkBeholder
cd ./BenchmarkBeholder
./bbh ./config/dummy.conf

This will give you an idea of how it works. After that, read through ./config/example.conf and start modifying it for your needs. BTW, you are welcome to check out other benchmark configurations under ./config ;)

# Detailed Installation Guide

BBH operates in a distributed environment that consists of three logical roles.

* **Central Node** is the host you're submitting benchmarks from. Usually, it's your local Linux machine or VM on the cloud you are going to use for benchmarking.

* **Database Node** is the host that stores the database of benchmark results. By default, it's the central host.

* **Benchmark Nodes** are the hosts you're running benchmarks on. As BBH is an agentless software, Benchmarks Nodes are actually ANY Linux hosts accessible via SSH.

To deploy BBH on a distributed environment, follow these steps.

**On your Central Node**

1. Install BBH on Central Node: git clone https://github.com/Yuri-Rassokhin/BenchmarkBeholder

2. To maximize the performance of BBH, it is recommended to reuse once-established SSH connections. To achieve this, run this code on the Central Node from the user that will be submitting benchmarks:

#!/bin/bash

SSH_CONFIG="$HOME/.ssh/config"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.ssh"
CONFIG_BLOCK="
Host *
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/control-%r@%h:%p
    ControlPersist 10m
"

# Check if the configuration block already exists
if grep -q "Host \*" "$SSH_CONFIG" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "Configuration block already exists in $SSH_CONFIG."
else
    # Append the configuration block to the SSH config file
    echo "$CONFIG_BLOCK" >> "$SSH_CONFIG"
    echo "Configuration block added to $SSH_CONFIG."
fi

# Set proper permissions on the SSH config file
chmod 600 "$SSH_CONFIG"

echo "Done."



mkdir -p ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/config
echo "Host *
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p
    ControlPersist yes" >> ~/.ssh/config

** Network Settings**

1. Ensure passwordless SSH access is enabled from the Central Node to Benchmark Nodes for the user that will be submitting benchmarks.

2. Ensure HTTP port 3306 is accessible from Benchmark Nodes to Database Node (which is the Central Node by default). This is required to push benchmarking results to the database.
