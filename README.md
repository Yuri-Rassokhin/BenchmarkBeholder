# BenchmarkBeholder

BBH is a tool for large-scale performance benchmarking of any application.

# What it is

BBH brings value to R&D in performance analysis in the long run, in the large projects, when you need to

* Benchmark your workloads in hundreds or thousands iterations
* Run benchmarks on many machines
* Collect results in a centralized way through months and years
* Involve multiple users or multiple project teams
* Make the results easily reproducible
* Store the results in a form convenient for BI, such as PowerBI or Excel

In other words, it comes in handy to those who created a quick script for benchmarking a while ago, and now is drawning in chaos as the project grows. BBH will be accurately accumulating your benchmark results at the organization level, and keep it for years in a centralized database, always ready for analysis.

# What it is NOT

* BBH is an overkill for just one-time launch of your benchmark
* BBH is not a benchmarking tool per se. Rather, it's a benchmarking framework that takes a given benchmarking tool (or application), runs it in given configurations, and collects associated metrics

# How does it work?

Any application can be integrated with BBH by writing a simple hook in Ruby. Out of box, BBH already has a collection of integrated applications.

BBH is invoked as the following:

* As input, BBH takes a config file describing *parameter space*, that is, a Cartesian of the valid values of all the parameters you want to benchmark your application against
* After that, BBH runs the application against all theÂ  combinations from the parameter space
* During the runs, BBH collects specified application metrics, enriches them with infrastructure metrics, and pushes everything to a database
* Finally, the database of benchmark grows as a single, centralized table structured in accordance with your projects and/or user teams

# Quick start

* git clone the BenchmarkBeholder repo
* ./bbh ./config/example.conf to grasp an idea of how it works
* After that, read through ./config/example.conf and start modifying it for your needs
